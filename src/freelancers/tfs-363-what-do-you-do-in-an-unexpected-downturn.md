Scott Heiser joins the panel to talk about healthcare hacks for freelancers. We start out joking about the COVID-19 quarantine situation. Healthcare and health insurance turns out to be a major headache for freelancers because it's usually tied to employment. ObamaCare got mentioned and discussed. Petra chimes in with the situation in Australia. Listen in to learn how you can make freelancing less painful on this particular front.
