**Panel:**

- Charles Max Wood
- Mark Erikson
- Josh Adams
- Eric Berry

**Special Guests:** Hubert Lepicki

In this episode of Elixir Mix, the panel talks to Hubert Lepicki about his blog post ["When to use Elixir language?"](https://www.amberbit.com/blog/2018/5/15/when-to-use-elixir-language/). Hubert works at [AmberBit](https://www.amberbit.com/) where they traditionally created [Ruby on Rails](https://rubyonrails.org/) apps for their customers, and more recently, they switched to using [Elixir](https://elixir-lang.org/) to build custom apps for their customers. They talk about why they decided to switch to Elixir, his thoughts on [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/) now, and the difference between Elixir and Ruby. They also touch on what his Ruby code looks like now, compare Elixir with [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/), and more!
