Charles originally interviewed Jonathan at a restaurant in Utah, but there was an issue with the recording and they wound up re-recording remotely due to COVID-19. Jonathan starts out talking about what it was like to put together a video for Clean Coders with Uncle Bob present. Jonathan then talks about taking Uncle Bob up to Snowbird to see where the Agile Manifesto was conceived and signed. We then talk about team organization, hiring, and other challenges of working in a team.
