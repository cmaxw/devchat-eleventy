Dee Dee Lavinder talks with the Rogues about how we can create space for introverts to participate in discussions, thereby getting their input in situations where we otherwise would not. She provides some tips for extroverts to invite the input, Luke brings his patented sarcasm to the table, we discuss some pitfalls and Dee really brings some fantastic advice to the table for those trying to moderate discussions as well as for those of us having small discussions with our colleagues.
