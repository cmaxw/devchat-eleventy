  "description": "Chances are if you're a JavaScript developer you're also writing CSS. When you first looked at CSS it probably seemed like a breeze. You added some border here, changed some background colors there. JavaScript was the hard part! Somewhere during your progression as a JavaScript developer that changed though! What's worse is that many of us have simply learned to dismiss CSS as a toy language. The truth, however, is that when we hit a wall many of us don’t actually know how to debug our styles sheets like we do our JavaScript! We all like to make jokes about it, but how many of us have actually taken the time to try and understand the CSS we're writing. How many of us have actually reasonably debugged an issue to the next lowest abstraction layer when we hit a wall? All too often we settle for the first StackOverflow answer, hacks, or we just let the issue go entirely. In this talk, we're going to finally take a step back and stop mindlessly throwing darts at the dart board! We’ll discuss the most common issues JavaScript developers face such as, z-index, the cascade, and positioning in depth by diving deep into the browser's internal rendering engine structure to see how our styles are parsed and rendered. Sure, you may still not have an eye for design, but you might just walk away a CSS guru!",
