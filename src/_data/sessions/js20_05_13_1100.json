  "title": "The Road to Reliable React Performance Monitoring",
  "description": "Every one of your users has a different setup, different habits, and a different workflow of your webapp. This makes monitoring performance difficult. Modern browsers provide tools to debug JavaScript performance issues but with two important caveats: it’s  manual, and it only provides insight into your JavaScript code, which is hard to translate into making your React code faster. In this talk, I'll explain how—through first instrumenting the new React APIs for Profiling and then using reproducible acceptance tests—I've been able to automate the detection of performance regressions, and how this can be integrated into a CI/CD pipeline.",
