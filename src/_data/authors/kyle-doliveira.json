  "bio": "Based in Vancouver, Canada, Kyle d'Oliveira is a jack of all trades and a master of some; at least he thinks so. He works as a staff software developer at Clio to readily turn abstract ideas into working pieces of software. He has worked on every major Rails version, and remembers the days when everyone implemented their own authentication system. When not developing, he enjoys picking up really heavy objects so that they can be put back down again.",
