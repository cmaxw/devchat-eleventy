  "bio": "Alex de Sousa is an Elixir Alchemist working remotely at Contractbook. He made Barcelona (Spain) his home base after moving from Caracas (Venezuela) in 2014. He and his wife Marta share the same passion for protecting the only planet in the Milky Way we can find chocolate. That's why they founded Refill Aqua in 2020. Refill Aqua's mission is to reduce single-use plastic pollution one bottle at the time in Barcelona (and eventually the World). When Alex is not working, probably you can find him wandering in the woods, biking around the city or lying on the sand of some beach.",
