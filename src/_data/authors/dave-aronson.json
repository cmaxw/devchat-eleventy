  "bio": "Dave Aronson is a software development consultant, meaning he slings code *and* gives advice about it.  Lately he has been trying to see the world by speaking at conferences, from Chisinau to Waikiki so far, mainly on mutation testing and his ACRUMEN model of software quality.  On personal notes, he is married, is owned by two cats, and enjoys smokey whiskeys, shooting targets, and playing guitar, not necessarily all at the same time.",
